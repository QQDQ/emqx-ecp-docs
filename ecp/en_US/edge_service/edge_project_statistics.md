## Basic Statistics

## NeuronEX Data Processing Statistics

- Total Record Input: Total input data in all running NeuronEX instances.

- Total Record Output: Total outflow data across all running NeuronEX instances.

- Average Input per Second: Average data inflow per second across all running NeuronEX instances

- Average Output per Second: average data outflow per second across all running NeuronEX instances

  

Underneath these two cards, you'll find the edge service list. This provides details about each instance, including category, name, endpoint, version, connection type, status, tags, and agent name. Moreover, you can perform O&M actions per instance.
