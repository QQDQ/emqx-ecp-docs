This chapter mainly introduces how to deploy ECP with [Kubernetes](install_ecp_on_kubernetes) or [ Docker](install_ecp_on_linux). There are certain functional differences between these two deployment methods, for details, see the table below.

After the installation, please configure [the ECP license](license_setting) and start your journey with this cloud-edge collaboration platform.
